# K-NN Algorithm - Python

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm** in **Python** as part of an assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming Paradigms** (OOPP) course. The algorithm performs data classification by analyzing the proximity of data points, introducing fundamental machine learning techniques.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Uses K-NN for data classification tasks.
- **Language**: Python

This project provides practical experience with Python and foundational machine learning concepts.
